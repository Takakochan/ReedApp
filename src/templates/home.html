<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-3">Welcome to The Reed App</h1>

<p class="text-lg text-indigo-800 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
  This web application is designed for double reed players, reed makers, and researchers who want to systematically collect, analyze, and compare data related to reed cane characteristics.
</p>

<p class="text-base text-indigo-800 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
  Whether you're tracking humidity, density, flexibility, or gouging machine details, this tool allows you to select the exact parameters you care about — and store, view, or analyze them over time.
</p>

<p class="text-base text-indigo-800 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
  The app includes features like automated density calculation based on dry and wet cane mass, dynamic form generation, and custom data visualizations to support informed reed making and performance decisions.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-900 mb-3">How to Use the App</h2>

<p class="text-base text-indigo-800 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
  Begin by visiting the <strong>Settings</strong> page, where you can choose which reed cane parameters you want to track — like humidity, density, cane brand, or gouging machine.
</p>

<p class="text-base text-indigo-800 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
  As you continue making reeds, enter data for each one using the form. Be sure to assign a unique <strong>Reed ID to every piece of cane</strong>, so you can update and analyze it over time.
</p>

<p class="text-base text-indigo-800 leading-relaxed">
  From automated density calculations to personalized tracking, this app helps transform your reed making into a structured, data-driven process.
</p>



<p class="text-base text-indigo-800 leading-relaxed">
  Built with Django and TailwindCSS, this project merges artisanal knowledge with modern web technology — because great reeds deserve great data.
